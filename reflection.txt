1. describes the effect of the P, I, D component of the PID algorithm

 P : improve the main error between the real and target, if big will shock around the taget, if small will deviate from the target
 I :  decrease the error for controller
 D:  avoid change too faster, make it more soomth.

2 discusses how they chose the final hyperparameters (P, I, D coefficients)

  first decide the param K, make it run quickly keep safe and fine; then try to select D to avoid turn too quickly at  tuning lane; at last, improve the I to decrase the error, make run more smooth
